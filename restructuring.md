# Restructuring Instructions

To complete the restructuring of the EduConnect project, follow these steps:

## 1. File Changes Already Made

The following changes have already been made to simplify the project structure:

- The root package.json metadata has been merged into the educonnect-frontend/package.json file
- The README.md file has been updated to reflect the new project structure

## 2. Manual Steps to Complete Restructuring

Please follow these steps to complete the restructuring:

1. **Move the Git Repository** (if you want to preserve Git history)
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the project root
   cd ..
   
   # Move the .git directory into the frontend folder
   mv .git educonnect-frontend/
   
   # Optional: Delete the now unnecessary files at the root
   rm package.json package-lock.json
   ```

2. **Set the Frontend Directory as the Main Project**
   ```bash
   # If you're deploying to services like Vercel, Netlify, etc.,
   # make sure to update the deployment configuration to point to this folder
   ```

3. **Update Project References**
   If you have any CI/CD configurations, documentation, or other references to 
   the project structure, update them to reflect the new organization.

## 3. After Restructuring

After completing these steps:

1. Run `npm install` inside the educonnect-frontend directory to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed
2. Test your application by running `npm run dev` to verify everything works correctly
3. Delete this restructuring.md file once the process is complete

Your project is now consolidated in a single directory, which will simplify development, deployment, and maintenance.
